# Alarm-clock-basic-python

Basic alarm clock script that prints text and plays a sound once set time meets current clock time.

This has been created by using the help of a tutorial for refreshment purposes. Code consists of a few variables, an if statement and a while loop to be executed until the condition is met which then plays a sound.
